# makeYourOwnRobot
In this tutorial we will build a robot that consists of 4 individually proportionally controlled servo motors.

Rotate
Up and down
Forward and backward
Grab and release

We use Arduino as a microcontroller management platform.  Through our computer, we can control the robot via serial commands (USB port).

The robot itself also has a recording and playback function so that repetitive tasks can be performed.

Moreover, the step size can be adjusted so that we can work with millimeter accuracy.

As hardware we use the technic blocks from the Heliwi.com construction kit.
